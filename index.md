Provisions in the *Nepal Citizenship Act 2006* and the proposed *Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019* are not only discriminatory but also regards women as inferior citizens and thus should concern all Nepalis with conscience.

These provisions are bound to violate women’s right and their child’s right to citizenship and more importantly **Nepal’s Constitution** that is founded on decades of revolution and sacrifices by countless women leaders and martyrs and dreams and aspirations of millions of Nepalis women throughout the world who hoped that the new constitution will bring them dignity, equality and opportunities.

The current gender-biased citizenship act is not only a women-based issue, it also directly violates male citizenship rights. There are many stateless children as a direct result of this act.

Gender equality is the first step of any civilized and democratic country. When you don’t have basic rights, one can imagine how unequal that society can be in many other fronts.

It’s time to get back to the basics and obtain equal rights and dignified treatment for women in and through the citizenship bill.

## What does Citizenship mean?

Citizenship means “The status of a person recognized under the custom or law as being a legal member of a sovereign state or belonging to a nation”. Nepal’s interim constitution has given equal rights to all.

**Article 18.2:** *No discrimination shall be made in the application of general laws on grounds of origin, religion, race, caste, tribe, sex, physical condition, condition of health, marital status, pregnancy, economic condition, language or region, ideology or on similar other grounds.*

**Article 18.3:** *The state shall not discriminate citizens on the grounds of origin, religion, race, caste, tribe, sex, economic condition, language, region, ideology, or on similar other grounds.*

## But what is being proposed?

Male lineage has been institutionalized as the basic standard of citizenship policy. A man can impart citizenship rights to his child without any concern about the child’s mother. Such a child is entitled to *Citizenship by Descent (वंशज)*.

But women are deprived of equal status when it comes to imparting citizenship to their children. A Nepali female can impart *Citizenship by Descent* to her child only if following conditions are met:

1.  If she can prove she does not know (verify through the Home Ministry) the identity of the biological father

2.  If the father is a Nepali citizen and provides consent that he has abandoned the kid

3.  If the father is not a Nepali citizen, the child will get *citizenship by naturalization (अंगिकृत)*.

In many cases, women need to go through the hassles of paperwork and face adverse social judgment because she does not know the identity of the biological father. **Several young people are deprived of citizenship and consequently rendered stateless due to this clause.**

Under the existing laws of Nepal, a person without citizenship is unable to pursue higher education, apply for a driving license or open a bank account, start a company or conduct business, enter any kind of formal service sector, and so on.

Consequently, a person becomes not only stateless, but also victimized with denial of social, political, and economic opportunities.

Clause 5.1 of the Citizenship Act 2006 grants naturalized citizenship to a foreign woman immediately after marriage with a Nepali man but the new amendment (2019) proposes 7 years for eligibility

However, a Nepali woman with citizenship by descent (वंशज) marrying a foreigner can never get her spouse any sort of recognition from the state as the law doesn’t speak anything about it. As a result, he will have to wait for a minimum of 15 years to become eligible for naturalized citizenship.

She’s also expected to prove that she resides in Nepal to keep retaining her citizenship. Furthermore, her child will only have the right to citizenship by naturalization.

## What is citizenship by naturalization?

Naturalization is a legal process for a ‘non-citizen’ to obtain citizenship of a country, contrary to the automatic process for children of a couple or single father bearing the concerned citizenship which we know as citizenship by descent.

Naturalization also involves renouncing previous citizenship(s).

A citizen by naturalization may avail social, economic and cultural rights but barred from political rights.

To be elected for the president, vice president, prime minister, chief justice, speaker of the house of representative, speaker of the national assembly, head of state, chief minister, speaker of the state assembly, chief of the security staff of the country, one must have citizenship by descent.

## Rules and Regulation:

1.  There are many citizens who are unaware of many provisions within this law and their implications. Our motive is to spread information; not to shame those who are not aware of the facts.

2.  Please post your ideas, (mis)understanding, concerns and criticisms vis-à-vis citizenship issue only and kindly refrain from diverting the issue

3.  This is an egalitarian movement seeking equal rights and treatment for women in citizenship legislation, but it has implications for everyone. Remember that injustice anywhere and by any means is a threat to justice everywhere.

4.  In any argument, persons are judged by how they present their opinions, not what their opinions are. Please present facts, evidence and sound logic to support your opinions, just don’t throw whatever is in that head. Doing some research and bearing passion for equality is a virtue everyone would appreciate

5.  Please refrain from using offensive languages, veiled or direct threats and baseless allegations against persons.

6.  Please refrain from shaming persons based on their gender, race, caste, age, and physical appearances and abilities or by any other measure
