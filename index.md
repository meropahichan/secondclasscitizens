The _Citizenship Act 2063_ and _Citizenship Amendment Act 2019_ directly violates women’s right, child’s right to citizenship and _Nepal’s constitution_itself. We must understand this gender-biased citizenship act is not only women based issue as it directly violates both male and female citizen's rights. There are many stateless children as a direct result of this act. It is infuriating that women are denied even basic human rights as citizens.  
  
Gender equality is the first step of any civilized and democratic country. When you don't have basic rights, what is the point of fighting for other inequalities? It’s time to go back to the basics. Get equal citizenship rights.
  
Citizenship means "The status of a person recognized under the custom or law as being a legal member of a sovereign state or belonging to a nation". Nepal’s interim constitution has given equal rights to all.  
  
_Article 18.2 states - No discrimination shall be made in the application of general laws on grounds of origin, religion, race, caste, tribe, sex, physical condition, condition of health, marital status, pregnancy, economic condition, language or region, ideology or on similar other grounds. Article 18.3 states - The state shall not discriminate citizens on the grounds of origin, religion, race, caste, tribe, sex, economic condition, language, region, ideology, or on similar other grounds._  
  
Male lineage has been institutionalized as the basic standard of citizenship policy. A man can impart citizenship rights to his child without any concern about the child’s mother. Such a child is entitled to _Citizenship by Descent (वंशज)_.  
  
Women, in particular, are deprived of equal status in imparting citizenship to their children. A female can impart citizenship right to her child but there are the following conditions:  

1.  If she can prove she does not know (verify through the home ministry) who the father is, the child can get citizenship by descent.
2.  If the father is a Nepalese citizen and has given the consent that he has abandoned the kid, the child will get citizenship by descent.
3.  If the father is not a Nepalese citizen, the child can get  _citizenship by naturalization (अंगिकृत)._

In many cases, women need to go through the hassles of paperwork and also face the shaming from society to prove that she does not know who the father is. There are millions of young people who do not have citizenship because of this clause.  
  
With the deprivation of citizenship, a child is rendered a stateless person. Under the existing laws of Nepal, a person without citizenship is not able to pursue higher education, apply for a driving license or a bank account, start a company or conduct business, enter into any kind of formal services, and so on. Consequently, a person becomes not only stateless, but also the victim of the denial of all social, political, and economic opportunities.  
  
Any male Nepali with citizenship by descent marrying a foreign woman can get her citizenship by naturalization immediately (New Amendment 2019 proposes in 7 years) but a female with citizenship by descent (वंशज) marrying a foreigner can never get her spouse any sort of recognition from the state. In addition, she’s also expected to prove that she resides in Nepal to keep retaining her citizenship. Furthermore, her child will only have the right to citizenship by naturalization.  
  
What is citizenship by naturalization?  
  
To be elected for the president, vice president, prime minister, chief justice, speaker of the house of representative, speaker of the national assembly, head of state, chief minister, speaker of the state assembly, chief of the security staff of the country, one must have citizenship by descent.
